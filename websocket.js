// JavaScript with WebSocket client and Tone.js implementation

const socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8765");

  console.log("WebSocket connection established.");
};

  const result = event.data;

  // Use the result with Tone.js for audio generation
  // Example: play sound based on the received result
  // You will need to implement this part according to your specific use case
};

// Continue with your Tone.js implementation and other script logic here
